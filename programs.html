                <p>ONLINE WORKSHOPS:</p>
                <p>Online workshops allow multiple people from various locations to be able to observe and participate in workshops from wherever they would like. While this is the optimal type of workshop due to inclusivity, certain things require in-person workshops.</p>

            <section class="in-person-description">
                <p>IN-PERSON WORKSHOPS:</p>
                <p>In-person workshops are about topics that must be introduced and worked through in person, such as many public speaking and leadership tasks.Recognizing that not everyone can participate in this, we have recorded each of the workshops and uploaded them on our resources page.</p>
